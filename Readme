🚀 Customer Segmentation & Marketing Strategy Using RFM Analysis

Understanding customer behavior is the key to business success! Recently, I conducted customer segmentation analysis on retail data using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis. The goal? To identify high-value customers, churn risks, and discount seekers – and create data-driven marketing strategies to increase retention and revenue. 📊

📊 RFM-Based Customer Clusters & Insights

Using clustering techniques, we grouped customers into four key segments based on their spending patterns and purchase recency. Here’s what we found: 👇

1️⃣ 💎 VIP & Loyal Customers (Cluster 2 - High Spending, Recent Buyers)✅ Regular, high-value purchases
✅ The most profitable customers
✅ 📢 Strategy: Offer loyalty programs, exclusive deals, and premium perks to retain them.

2️⃣ 🎯 Engaged Shoppers (Cluster 3 - Moderate Spending, Active Buyers)✅ Recently active but spend less than VIPs
✅ Show strong potential for growth
✅ 📢 Strategy: Use personalized recommendations and special discounts to increase order size.

3️⃣ ⚠️ Churn Risk Customers (Cluster 1 - Low Spending, Inactive Buyers)❌ Haven’t purchased in a long time
❌ Low frequency & spending
✅ 📢 Strategy: Implement win-back campaigns, re-engagement emails, and exclusive comeback offers to revive interest.

4️⃣ 🚶 One-Time Buyers (Cluster 0 - Very Low Spending, Long Recency)❌ Bought once and never returned
❌ Unlikely to engage without strong incentives
✅ 📢 Strategy: Focus on mass email promotions or seasonal offers to reintroduce them to the brand.
